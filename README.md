# CardMatch

This git repository is for the game Card match, which was made by Steven Johnson for SIT313 Assignment 1.

The aim of the game is to flip a card and find the matching card within the grid of cards.  The player must
remember the position of cards they have flipped in the past in order to achieve the best score possible.

The game features two modes:

Normal Mode:
The grid of cards can contain many pairs of a single type of card.  Flips are recorded in this mode.

Challenge Mode:
The grid of cards only contains one pair of each type of card.  This makes it harder, as the player must 
rembember the positions of the cards more carefully as they need to find the exact match, as opposed to
normal where they can possibly find the same card in multiple locations
